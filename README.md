# A classic online store with basic functionality

### The basic functionality of this online store includes:

- Product catalog - a list of all products sold in the online store. The catalog can be structured by categories, brands, price ranges, and other product characteristics.

- User authorization - allows for more convenient and personalized user interaction with the online store, as well as increasing the security of online purchases.

- Checkout process - the process that allows the buyer to select products from the catalog, add them to the cart, and place an order. In this process, the buyer usually provides delivery address, payment method, and other necessary information.

- Site administration - allows for managing the content of the site, configuring and updating functionality, controlling order processing and customer interactions.

### At the request of the client, this functionality can be supplemented and expanded with the following options:

- Payment system - an online system that processes payments from buyers. Typically, an online store works with several payment systems to provide buyers with various payment options, such as credit cards, electronic money, bank transfers, etc.

- Order management - the process that allows the store to manage all orders from start to finish. This includes order processing, notifying buyers of the status of their orders, delivery, and tracking the delivery status.

- Inventory management - the process that allows the store to manage inventory levels, receive information about product availability, and manage supplies.

- Customer service - customer support that provides feedback between the buyer and the store. Customer service may include online chats, email, and support phone lines.
